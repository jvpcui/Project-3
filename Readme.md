   This is an application for cleaning up files that are not used frequently by computers.
   To start, you can set the size of the infrequently used files you want to find with an 's-number', and for how long haven't you used them with a 't-number'.
   After that, to specify the directory you need to clean up: The application will indicate the top 10 files sorted by file size and the top 10 files sorted by time.
   Last step, you can now delete the files found using the key 'y'.
